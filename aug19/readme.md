Create a query to report the amount of rented movies by category and country.

How many movies of action does each country rent?

You should have an input like:

India Action 19
India Child 10
India Adventure 14

etc, etc, etc...

Try different ways of getting the same result (joins and subqueries) and see which is faster.
