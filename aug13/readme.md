# Instructions

Create an E-R Diagram (if possible, create the DB, tables and some data) to store school data with the following requirements:

- We can store **students** first name and last name
- We can create **courses** with **teachers** assigned to them
- We can subscribe students to **different** courses
- We can store **grades** for each subscribed student
- Students can only subscribe to one course at the time. IE: A student can't exists twice in the math course. This relation must be **UNIQUE** ;)
- Students can be in multiple courses: Math, English, Physics, etc.

Think of any real life conditions that can happen in this scenario and how we can control it within our Database.

If you don't have time to complete it, bring something written in a napkin at least. Don't come to the class on empty hands.
